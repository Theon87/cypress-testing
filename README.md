# Cypress Testing

## Description

This app will demonstrate the utility of cypress as a tool for testing your code. It will demonstrate testing a component as well as a test that mimics the user experience of using an app by testing a series of clicks through the app. Running tests such as these will make your app more robust and increase the likelyhood of a better user experience. 

## Installation
